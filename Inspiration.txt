A Visual Studio extension that creates an editor for files with extension .vslink.  A vslink file is plain old text containing a path to an external code file.  The vslink editor provides editing of the external code file.  The difference between vslink and a linked file is that the external source will not be added to team foundation server.  The inspiration for vslink is for adding per-developer test settings to a solution and not have those settings imported into source control.
